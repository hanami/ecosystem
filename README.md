# Hanami Ecosystem
This repository will include guides and documentation for integrating projects
from the Ruby ecosystem into Hanami.

## Mission
We strive to make Hanami a good Ruby citizen.

This means we want to ensure common libraries work well with Hanami,
*and* it also means that we want to ensure that Hanami works well with others too!
